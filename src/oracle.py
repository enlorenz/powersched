"""Liquid oracle: theoretical lower bound on electricity cost for a given workload.

The liquid oracle answers: given perfect knowledge of all arriving jobs and prices
for an episode, and the freedom to run any job at any hour (no arrival-time or
deadline constraints), what is the minimum achievable electricity cost?

It treats the workload as a divisible fluid -- total core-hours -- and redistributes
it greedily to the cheapest hours first, up to cluster capacity.  This is an
optimistic lower bound; real schedulers face arrival times, deadlines, and discrete
job sizes that the oracle ignores.

Use it as a benchmark: the gap between baseline_off and oracle is the maximum
workload-shifting savings available in principle.  The fraction of that gap captured
by the agent is how close to optimal the agent is.
